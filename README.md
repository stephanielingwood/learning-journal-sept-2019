Hi, I'm Stephanie, and this is my learning journal for 102! My github page is [here](https://github.com/stephanielingwood) - go visit it. 

### Day 2

The terminal is awesome! Check out some of the commands I learned:
- `ls` - list files
- `ls -la` - list all files, including hidden ones, in a "detail view" (list format)
- `cd my-directory` - change into a certain directory. In this case, the directory is named `my-directory`
- `mkdir new-directory` - make a new directory
- `pwd` - show what directory I'm currently in

### Day 3

I love git. I can add, commit, and push. So cool!
